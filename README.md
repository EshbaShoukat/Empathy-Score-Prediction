# Enhancing Insights from Eye Tracking Data: Unveiling Patterns and Distinctions between Test and Control Groups
The goal of this research was to create prediction models for analyzing eye tracking data in order to get significant insights. The goal of this research was to create prediction models for analyzing eye tracking data in order to get significant insights. We handled data quality by cleaning it thoroughly and dealing with missing numbers. Several regression models were used in our method, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. We discovered that the Random Forest Regressor performed the best, with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 848.88 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 29.14. This study is significant in improving
our comprehension of eye tracking data patterns and adds to decision-making processes when eye tracking insights are critical. This study is significant in improving our comprehension of eye tracking
data patterns and adds to decision-making processes when eye tracking insights are critical. In conclusion, our research highlights the significance of extensive data cleansing for successful predictive modelling.
The findings highlight the superiority of the Random Forest Regressor, implying its application in realworld settings demanding accurate predictions.
